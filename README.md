# 🌐 Exploring Service APIs through Test Automation 
> **Learning Path:** My collection of notes, exercises, and scripts based on the [TAU course by Amber Race](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/exploring-service-apis-through-test-automation/)

---
## 🚀 Overview
#### This repository tracks my progress in mastering API testing, moving from manual exploration to automated validation. The goal is to understand the "contract" between services and ensure robust data exchange.
